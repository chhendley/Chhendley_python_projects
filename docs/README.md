### Hi, I'm Chris.
#### These are my Python projects so far. 

***

#### Lane Detection
  This project uses computer vision techniques to identify the lines painted on the road to designate a lane while a car is in motion.
  It has a link to a short video which is used for demonstration purposes.

#### Medical journal abstract classfier
  This project uses natural language processing techniques to classify journal abstract into 5 different categories with approximately   60% accuracy. It includes a link to the original Kaggle dataset used in this project.

#### Sugar consumption Dashboard
  This project uses Plotly DASH to create an interactive dashboard to view sugar consumption by region according to USDA data.

#### Tic Tac Toe robot
  This program uses Q learning to train a robot to play tic tac toe.  After the training is complete the user can play the bot in a      game of tic tac toe.

#### US Cancer incidence predictor
  This project uses ARIMA and Facebook Prophet to predict the number of new cancer diagnoses in the US over 4 years. Training 
  data was pulled from the CDC.

#### About Chris:
I am a data enthusiast who enjoys solving problems with code.  My main programming language is Python as you can tell, but I have used SQL as well.
