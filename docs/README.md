### Projects: Lane detection, Medical journal abstract classifier, Sugar consumption dashboard, Tic Tac Toe robot, US Cancer incidence predictor


## Lane Detection
  This project uses computer vision techniques to identify the lines painted on the road to designate a lane while a car is in motion.
  It has a link to a short video which is used for demonstration purposes

## Medical journal abstract classfier
  This project uses natural language processing techniques to classify journal abstract into 5 different categories with approximately   60% accuracy. It includes a link to the original Kaggle dataset used in this project.

## Sugar consumption Dashboard
  This project uses Plotly DASH to create an interactive dashboard to view sugar consumption by region according to USDA data.
  [Sugar consumption dashboard](chhendley_python_projects/sugar_DASH.ipynb)

## Tic Tac Toe robot
  This program uses Q learning to train a robot to play tic tac toe.  After the training is complete the user can play the bot in a      game of tic tac toe.

## US Cancer incidence predictor
  This project uses ARIMA and Facebook Prophet to predict the number of new cancer diagnoses in the US over the next 3 years. Training 
  data was pulled from the CDC.
